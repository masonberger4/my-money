## Architecture (decided, don't relitigate)

- **Cloud-first**: Supabase Postgres is the single source of truth. No local
  cache / IndexedDB (Dexie was removed — don't reintroduce).
- **React + Vite SPA** on **Vercel**; secrets live in serverless `api/`
  functions. Client reads/writes Supabase directly (RLS-scoped) and calls `api/`
  only for service-secret work (the SimpleFIN access URL, the assistant key).
- **ONE bank feed: SimpleFIN**, plus CSV/PDF statement import as the permanent
  coverage floor for anything it can't reach. **Plaid is gone** (phase 4) —
  don't reintroduce it; ~$15/yr flat beat its per-Item billing, which was the
  whole point of the migration.
  - Two dead ends left their names behind, and both are load-bearing today:
    a scraper that was designed then abandoned (`synthetic_id`, renamed
    `plaid_tx_id`), and Plaid itself. **`transactions.plaid_tx_id` and
    `accounts.plaid_account_id` are ADAPTER-AGNOSTIC external ids** carrying
    every feed's id space — `sfin:`, `csv:` (both CSV *and* PDF), `manual:` —
    and both upsert conflict targets. Never rename or drop them; the name is
    ugly, the column is critical. `test/noPlaid.test.js` asserts the cleanup
    guard doesn't start flagging them.
  - Feed discriminator: `institutions.simplefin_org_id is not null` ⇒
    SimpleFIN-fed; null ⇒ the manual "Imported" institution, which stays
    `status='disabled'` permanently — don't "fix" that status; it is what keeps
    the manual institution out of every sync path. Load-bearing a second way
    since 2026-08-13: because that status never changes, it can't double as
    the "removed" tombstone the SimpleFIN branch uses, so the manual
    soft-hide's marker is its `unlink:<id>` settings record (the
    `api/_lib/unlink.js` key row).
  - **New SimpleFIN accounts arrive `hidden: true`.** The original reason (a
    bank on both feeds would double-count) is gone, but the rule stays for the
    surviving one: the account's TYPE is *guessed* from its name, and unhiding
    is the deliberate act that confirms the guess. A card mistyped as checking
    corrupts three separate numbers — see the account-type Convention for
    which and why.
- **Auth**: one shared Supabase Auth user for the household.
  `household_members` maps user → household; `current_household_id()` + RLS
  policies scope every table. `api/` routes verify the JWT via `requireUser()`
  (`api/_lib/supabase.js`). Sign-out MUST stay
  `supabase.auth.signOut({ scope: 'local' })` — supabase-js v2 defaults to
  `'global'`, which revokes EVERY refresh token of the one shared user, so
  signing out the laptop would drop the other phone within the hour,
  contradicting the "on this device" confirm text.
- **RLS shape**: `accounts` / `transactions` / `institutions` each have a single
  `for all to authenticated using (…) with check (household_id =
  current_household_id())` policy — INSERT is gated by the WITH CHECK, satisfied
  because `household_id` defaults to `current_household_id()`, so the **client
  can INSERT/update/delete its own rows directly**. `simplefin_access` has ZERO
  client policies — only service_role (api/) reads it. Never expose it: the
  access URL embeds the household's bank credentials.
- **Sync is server-side** (`api/sync.js`), ONE pass, upserting accounts
  (onConflict `institution_id,plaid_account_id`) and transactions (onConflict
  `account_id,plaid_tx_id`), limited to `depository`+`credit`+`loan`
  (`ALLOWED_TYPES`); loans carry sparse/no transactions — their debt data is
  hand-entered (see Roadmap).
  - **SimpleFIN pass**: per *access URL*, not per institution — one URL covers
    every bank, fetched in a single GET with no cursor and no pagination. Fans
    out into institutions (one per SimpleFIN org), accounts and transactions.
    Incremental via a `last_pulled_at` watermark minus a 30-day overlap, and
    every request is clamped to **~88 days** (`MAX_LOOKBACK_DAYS`) because
    SimpleFIN serves at most 90 per call. `FIRST_PULL_DAYS` (730) stays the reach
    we WANT — the difference is reported as a `coverage_shortfall`, not quietly
    redefined, because the constant is the only record that older history was
    never fetched.
    `last_pulled_at` (data watermark, advanced when **no REAL error** came back —
    a date-range advisory is NOT an error, see the gotcha; so is a *capped*
    range, since stalling recovers nothing) and `last_attempt_at` (throttle,
    stamped **before** the request so a timeout still counts) are deliberately
    two columns — one column would force a choice between skipping transactions
    after a failure and re-hitting the Bridge on every dashboard load while a
    connection is broken. The throttle stamp is written as a NULL-safe
    CONDITIONAL update, guarding the two-device race — keep it conditional.
    One pull an hour (SimpleFIN refreshes ~daily).
